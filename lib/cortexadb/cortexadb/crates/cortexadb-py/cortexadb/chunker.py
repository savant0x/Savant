cortexadb.chunker — text chunking utilities.

Wraps the Rust chunker for multiple strategies:
- fixed: Character-based with word-boundary snapping
- recursive: Paragraph → sentence → word (general purpose)
- semantic: Split by paragraphs
- markdown: Preserve headers, lists, code blocks
- json: Flatten JSON to key-value pairs

    Split text using the specified chunking strategy.

    Args:
        text: The input text to chunk.
        strategy: Chunking strategy - "fixed", "recursive", "semantic", "markdown", or "json".
                  Default: "recursive"
        chunk_size: Target size of each chunk in characters (for fixed/recursive).
                    Default: 512
        overlap: Number of words to overlap between consecutive chunks.
                 Default: 50

        - text: The chunk text

        - metadata: Optional dict with additional info (e.g., key/value for json strategy)
